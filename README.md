# flat's guix channel

This is a personal collection of [GNU Guix][guix] package definitions.  Refer
to the manual for more information on [Guix Channels][guix-channel].

## Packages

### emacs-native-comp

Emacs built with support for native compilation of Elisp.

This package once tracked the `feature/native-comp` branch on savannah, but
now tracks `emacs-28` as the feature was merged for inclusion in Emacs 28.

See [GccEmacs][gccemacs] for more information.

### emacs-pgtk-native-comp

Emacs built with support for native compilation of Elisp and a new "pure" GTK3
rendering engine, bringing support for Wayland and improved performance on X.

This package tracks an unofficial [pgtk-nativecomp][flatwhatson-pgtk] branch,
which was once a merge of the `feature/pgtk` and `feature/native-comp`
branches on savannah.  Since native compilation was merged for inclusion in
Emacs 28, this branch is a merge of `feature/pgtk` and `emacs-28`.

See [masm11's branch][masm11-pgtk] for more information on PGTK.

### libgccjit-11

An updated `libgccjit` package based on `gcc-11`.  The `libgccjit` package in
Guix is based on `gcc-9`, which is missing some changes that are important for
`emacs-native-comp` performance.

## Usage

### via load-path

The simplest way to use this channel is to temporarily add it to Guix's
load-path:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/cl4rknova/guix-channel.git
guix install -L ./guix-channel emacs-native-comp
```

### via channels.scm

A more permanent solution is to configure Guix to use this channel as an
*additional channel*.  This will extend your package collection with
definitions from this channel.  Updates will be received (and authenticated)
with `guix pull`.

To use the channel, add it to your configuration in
`~/.config/guix/channels.scm`:

``` scheme
(cons* (channel
        (name 'flat)
        (url "https://github.com/cl4rknova/guix-channel.git")
        (introduction
         (make-channel-introduction
          "42f5a932f69e67180b577d9fab29ea3ca84097e8"
          (openpgp-fingerprint
           "5B85 0A07 DB01 FD6F D9C4  406E 2B52 F213 425A A0D1"))))
       %default-channels)
```

With the channel configured, it can be used as follows:


``` shell
guix pull
guix search emacs-native-comp
guix install emacs-native-comp
```
